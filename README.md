# AlzheimersERP
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for scikit-learn machine learning models for early detection of Alzheimer's disease using event-related potentials.

The **data** directory contains the datasets.  Further descriptions of each dataset are in the datasets.txt file. 

The **models** directory contains Jupyter notebooks for training machine learning models.

The **stats** directory contains Jupyter notebooks for other statistical measurements of the data (just ANOVA right now).

The **visualizations** directory contains Jupyter notebooks for some distplots and correlation plots for features.
